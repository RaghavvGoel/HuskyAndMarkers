The two folders above are divided in the following ways:
1. Husky

Consists of all the files for opening multi agent simulation in Gazebo.

2. UsingPython2

Consists all the codes written in python. 

You need to have ROS-KINETIC installed. ROS comes pre installed with RVIZ and Gazebo. 

For seeing a visual of how it works, 
1. you'll need to start the RVIZ : command on terminal : rosrun rviz rviz 
2. then change the Fixed frame tag on the left side top of RVIZ to whatever is mentioned inside the main() function 
   where the markers are  implemented. 
3. Then you'll need to add MarkerArray from the add button left side down. 
4. Then put the Marker Topic as mentioned in the code. Marker Topic is the same as the Publisher name of the marker, 
   just below the main().
